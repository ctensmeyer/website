I taught CS478 (Machine Learning and Data Mining) at Brigham Young University in the Fall 2015 semester.  We covered topics such as neural networks, decision trees, K-nearest neighbor, and clustering algorithms.

I have also been a teaching assistant a few times:

- CS236: Discrete Structures
- CS312: Algorithm Design & Analysis
- CS478: Machine Learning and Data Mining (x2)
